 <p>Are you also an upcoming student who wants to have conversations with Humber student ambassadors or read about their campus experiences? This website has got you covered.</p>
  <p>Humber College has appointed a select group of student ambassadors to foster effective communication between current students and incoming ones. These ambassadors provide guidance, respond to inquiries, and share their campus experiences to help new students transition smoothly into college life.
    This initiative by Humber is a commendable step toward enhancing student engagement and support.<p>
    <p>To further simplify the process, I developed this website to facilitate direct access to these ambassadors, enabling prospective students to easily connect, seek assistance, and gain insights from their experiences.</p>

    <h2 id="about-section" class="status">AN UPCOMING STUDENT</h2>
     <p>I'm Seleem by name, from Nigeria. <p>
      I'm an upcoming student who wants to study Web Design and Development.
    <p> I've got a passion for this course. I like coding and creating things people can benefit from or interact with, which is one of the reasons I chose this path.</p>
    <p> I find joy in creating something and being able to say, “I made this.” It always sounds nice to me. I'm also excited to be part of the tech industry, which continuously evolves. </p> 
    <p>I chose Humber College ahead of other colleges because of the courses they offered in this program, how it’s structured, and how it’s going to be taught. I think it’s going to be intriguing. <p>
